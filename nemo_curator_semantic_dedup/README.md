# Image Semantic Deduplication with NeMo Curator

This example uses [NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Curator) to perform GPU-accelerated semantic deduplication on image datasets. It reads image URLs from a HuggingFace parquet dataset, downloads them into [WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) tar shards, generates CLIP embeddings on GPUs, clusters them with K-means + DBSCAN to find near-duplicates, and writes a clean deduplicated dataset.

## Install the Anyscale CLI (required version = 0.26.82+)

```bash
pip install -U anyscale
anyscale login
```

## Run the job

Clone the example from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anyscale/examples.git
cd examples/nemo_curator_semantic_dedup
```

Submit the job. Use `--env` to forward your HuggingFace token for dataset access.

```bash
anyscale job submit -f job.yaml --env HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN
```

## How it works

The entrypoint defined in [job.yaml](./job.yaml) runs [image_dedup_example.py](./image_dedup_example.py), which executes four steps:

```
HuggingFace parquet (URLs + captions)
    │
    ▼
Step 1: Download images → WebDataset tar shards
    │
    ▼
Step 2: Generate CLIP embeddings (GPU)
    │
    ▼
Step 3: Semantic deduplication (K-means + DBSCAN)
    │
    ▼
Step 4: Write deduplicated dataset (new tar shards without duplicates)
```

### Step 1: Parquet to WebDataset

`main()` calls `parquet_to_webdataset_ray()` in [helper.py](./helper.py), which builds a Ray Data pipeline to download images and pack them into WebDataset tar shards:

```
read_parquet (HF) → repartition → map_batches(download) → flat_map(validate) → map_batches(write_tar)
```

| Ray Data operator | Function | What it does |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| `read_parquet` | — | Lazily reads `url` and `caption` columns from HuggingFace via `HfFileSystem`. |
| `repartition` | — | Splits large parquet blocks (~millions of rows) into ~1000-row blocks so Ray can parallelize downstream work across the cluster. |
| `map_batches` | `image_download_batch` | Downloads images in batches of 100. Within each Ray task, a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 50 threads downloads URLs concurrently — so you get parallelism at two levels: Ray distributes batches across cluster CPUs, and threads parallelize I/O within each batch. |
| `flat_map` | `process_image` | Validates each image with Pillow (`.verify()`), converts to RGB JPEG, and drops failures by returning `[]`. Handles all image modes (RGBA, palette, grayscale, CMYK) by compositing onto a white background. |
| `map_batches` | `write_tar_batch` | Packs `ENTRIES_PER_TAR` images (default 500) into a single `.tar` shard on cluster storage. Each shard gets a unique name based on node ID + UUID to avoid collisions when multiple nodes write simultaneously. |

The entire pipeline streams end-to-end — Ray Data handles backpressure so fast stages don't overwhelm slow ones, and data flows through without loading the full dataset into memory. `.take_all()` at the end triggers execution.

### Step 2: Image embedding pipeline

`create_image_embedding_pipeline()` builds a NeMo Curator `Pipeline` with five stages:

| Stage | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `FilePartitioningStage` | Discovers `.tar` files and groups them into partitions (`tar_files_per_partition=1`). Not a bottleneck at this scale — GPU throughput on the embedding stage is. |
| `ImageReaderStage` | Reads images from tar shards. DALI decodes JPEGs on the GPU. |
| `ImageEmbeddingStage` | Runs OpenAI CLIP ViT-L/14 to produce 768-dimensional embeddings for each image. |
| `ConvertImageBatchToDocumentBatchStage` | Converts from `ImageBatch` (numpy pixel arrays) to `DocumentBatch` (DataFrames), keeping only `image_id` and `embedding`. |
| `ParquetWriter` | Saves embeddings to parquet files on cluster storage. |

This pipeline runs on a `RayDataExecutor`, which treats the stages as a streaming dataflow — data flows through one batch at a time in a producer-consumer pattern. It's well suited for stages that process data independently without coordination between workers.

### Step 3: Semantic deduplication workflow

`SemanticDeduplicationWorkflow` is where the actual deduplication happens:

1. **K-means clustering** (`n_clusters=100`) — groups similar embeddings together using RAFT/NCCL across all GPU actors.
2. **DBSCAN within clusters** (`eps=0.01`) — finds near-duplicate pairs based on cosine distance within each cluster.

This step runs on a `RayActorPoolExecutor`, which creates a fixed pool of long-lived Ray actors, each holding a GPU. This is needed because K-means requires state across batches — all GPU actors must coordinate via RAFT/NCCL to fit a single model across the full dataset. A stateless streaming executor can't do that.

### Step 4: Write deduplicated dataset

`create_image_deduplication_pipeline()` re-reads the original tar shards, filters out images whose IDs appear in the removal list, and writes new tar shards. You can't selectively remove files from a tar archive — tar is a flat concatenation of file records with no editable index — so writing new shards without the duplicates is the only option. `ImageWriterStage` re-encodes each image's numpy pixel array back to JPEG with Pillow, packs them into new `.tar` files (up to 1000 images per tar), and writes a companion `.parquet` with metadata (`image_id`, `tar_file`, `member_name`, `original_path`).

## Cluster storage

All intermediate and output data lives under `/mnt/cluster_storage/`, a shared network filesystem (backed by S3) that is automatically mounted on every node in the cluster. This is necessary because Steps 2, 3, and 4 run as separate pipeline executions with different executors (`RayDataExecutor` for streaming stages, `RayActorPoolExecutor` for K-means). When one step finishes, its data is no longer in memory — the next step reads it back from disk. A shared filesystem ensures any node can read what any other node wrote, regardless of which step produced it.

| Step | Directory | Contents |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | `webdataset/` | WebDataset `.tar` files (downloaded images) |
| 2 | `embeddings/` | Parquet files with `image_id` + embedding vectors |
| 3 | `removal_ids/` | K-means results, pairwise results, and `duplicates/` parquet listing IDs to remove |
| 4 | `results/` | Final deduplicated WebDataset `.tar` files |

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables in [job.yaml](./job.yaml). Override them at submit time:

```bash
anyscale job submit -f job.yaml \
  --env HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN
```

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) builds a custom image with NeMo Curator's CUDA dependencies (`nemo-curator[image_cuda12]`), including DALI, cuML, and RAFT. The NeMo Curator Python package itself is overridden at runtime via `PYTHONPATH=Curator` in job.yaml, which points to a local `Curator/` directory uploaded with the working directory.
