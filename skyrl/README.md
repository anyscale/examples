# GRPO with SkyRL

This example uses [SkyRL](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL) to run GRPO training on the GSM8K dataset.

SkyRL is a modular and extensible reinforcement learning library for training large language models. It supports RL algorithms like PPO, GRPO, and DAPO, tool-use tasks, and multi-turn agentic workflows.

## Install the Anyscale CLI

```bash
pip install -U anyscale
anyscale login
```

## Deploy the service

Clone the example from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anyscale/examples.git
cd examples/skyrl
```

Deploy the service.

```bash
anyscale job submit -f job.yaml
```

## Understanding the example

- The entrypoint defined in the [job.yaml](https://github.com/anyscale/examples/blob/main/skyrl/job.yaml) first runs a script to download the GSM8K dataset and store it under `/mnt/cluster_storage/data/gsm8k`. The `/mnt/cluster_storage/` directory is an ephemeral shared filesystem attached to the cluster for the duration of the job (this ensures that all workers have access to the data).
- The main entrypoint, `skyrl_train.entrypoints.main_base`, is run using `uv`, which picks up the relevant [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/blob/main/skyrl-train/pyproject.toml) file in the SkyRL repository. That file specifies a Ray version, but we actually want to use the version of Ray used in the existing Ray cluster on Anyscale, which is why the `uv run` command includes the flag `--with ray@http://localhost:9478/ray/ray-2.48.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl`.
- In this example, we cannot set the `working_dir` argument in the job yaml file because `uv` will look for the appropriate `pyproject.toml` file in that working directory (and won't find it) instead of in the correct directory `$HOME/SkyRL/skyrl-train`.
- To store checkpoints in a persistent location, you can pass `ckpt_path` into the entrypoint. Read more about [Anyscale storage options](https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/storage). This examples saves checkpoints to a mounted shared filesystem via `ckpt_path=/mnt/shared_storage/skyrl_checkpoints`. If you would like to save checkpoints to blob storage, you could set `ckpt_path=$ANYSCALE_ARTIFACT_STORAGE/skyrl_checkpoints`. On AWS you will also need to modify the main entrypoint to include `--with s3fs` in the `uv run` command, and you'll need `--with gcsfs` on GCP.
